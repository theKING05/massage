                                    A massage can benefit you physically and mentally
                                            <span><h6>By Unwritten</h6></span>

           <p>       
                Massage is a very effective way to destress, unwind, and relax after a long day. It’s 
                also great for your physical health, since it helps relax muscles, release tension, 
                improve circulation, and more.Thanks to a massage, you’ll have greater flexibility and
                range of motion and you will be able to maintain that if you get massage therapy 
                regularly.In turn, this can help you stay limber and avoid injuries. However, what you 
                might not realize is how important massage therapy is for your mental health.

                <h3>1. It relieves depression and anxiety.</h3>
                <p>
                    Depression and anxiety are tough to handle and affects 67 percent of all Canadians. 
                    This has a negative impact on your life and can be hard to treat.The good news, 
                    however, is that studies show that massage therapy can decrease such symptoms. 
                    Researchers in Taiwan reviewed 17 studies finding that massage benefits those 
                    suffering from depression and leads to a reduction in its symptoms.Furthermore, 
                    researchers in Japan found that massage activates the sympathetic nervous system,
                    which reduces anxiety and improves mood. So, if you’re struggling with depression
                    or anxiety, a massage can be the way to go.
                </p>    
                <h3>2. It lowers anxiety and stress.</h3>
                <p>
                    Massage therapy activates neurotransmitters in your body, which can lower your stress
                    hormones and decrease anxiety. In fact, researchers have found a 30 percent increase 
                    in dopamine and serotonin levels in those who undergo massage.
                    If you’re struggling with anxiety or stress, then taking time out to get a massage may
                    be exactly what you need — not only emotionally, but physically — to lower your stress.
                    Schedule an appointment with your local massage therapist to find relief.
                </p>    
                <h3>3. It helps with emotions related to ongoing illness.</h3>
                <p>
                    A lot of people with a chronic illness feel helpless and aren’t sure where to turn. 
                    This can lead to anxiety, stress, and anger. Massage therapy has been shown to alleviate 
                    these symptoms in people with serious illnesses.
                    Moreover, people who receive massage had less anxiety, stress, and anger than a control 
                    group. They also had less of a neurotransmitter linked to depression.However, make sure 
                    to see a medical professional in order to ensure massage therapy is appropriate for your 
                    health issues. For instance, those with blood clots should not receive a massage.
                </p>
                <h3>4. It helps with symptoms of PTSD.</h3>
                <p>
                    Veterans who come home from war with PTSD symptoms have trouble adjusting to life back home. 
                    Thus, massage therapy can be part of a comprehensive program that helps them learn to relax 
                    again and get the healthy sleep they need.
                    Furthermore, massage therapy has been shown to help veterans reduce pain, irritability, 
                    tension, worry, and anxiety. As part of a comprehensive transition program, massage therapy 
                    can make a big difference in the lives of those with PTSD.
                </p>
                <h3>5. Even a chair massage helps.</h3>
                <p>
                    Studies performed on healthcare workers who struggle with stress, tension, and even 
                    insomnia show that having a 10-minute chair massage once a week helps nurses with 
                    joint and muscle pain, fatigue, shoulder tension, and headaches.
                    Moreover, their sleep quality improved. However, don’t think that you have to get an
                    hour massage to get the benefits. Even 10 minutes can make a huge difference when 
                    done regularly. 
                    Now that you understand the physical and mental health benefits of massages, you can 
                    see why massage therapy with a massage or physiotherapy clinic should be a part of 
                    your life.
